# ðŸŸ¡ Agentic Pac-Man RLHF

This project is a modular reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed around the classic Pac-Man game, extended with principles of **agentic behavior** and **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**.

It serves as an academic and exploratory implementation of RL agents capable of learning navigation and decision-making strategies through both automated reward shaping and human-in-the-loop feedback simulation.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- **Q-Learning and Value Iteration Agents**: Traditional RL algorithms implemented and tested in a controlled grid environment.
- **Agentic Reasoning Loop**: Modular agent design simulating multiple sub-goal planning behaviors.
- **RLHF-Inspired Feedback**: Simulated human corrections injected during training phases to bias reward functions toward desired behaviors.
- **University Robotics Simulation**: Deployed in simulated environments to test adaptability under realistic constraints.
- **Performance Gains**: Improved task success rate from **72% to 89%** and reduced policy instability by **40%** after feedback tuning.
